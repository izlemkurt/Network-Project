# Computer-Network-Project

Implemented a client-server application, which will operate as a cloud file
storage and publishing system. In the application, there is a Server module which stores
and manages files uploaded by Client modules. Each file on the server belongs to the client
who uploaded it and only that client can delete, copy or choose to publish the file so that other
clients in the system can download.
Used socket programming and graphical user interface on C#.
