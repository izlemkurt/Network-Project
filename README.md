# Computer-Network-Project

Implemented a client-server application, which will operate as a cloud file storage and publishing system by using socket programming and graphical user interface on C#.
In the application, there is a Server module which stores and manages files uploaded by Client modules. Each file on the server belongs to the client
who uploaded it and only that client can delete, copy or choose to publish the file so that other clients in the system can download.
